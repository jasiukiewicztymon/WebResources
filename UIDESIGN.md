## Three steps to organize UI

### 1. Zoning

We define big blocs of content to struct our page. Designers do it to add keywords to those pages and add a position with precise size.

### 2. Wireframes

Wireframes are simplified interfaces, page by page to organize and understand the content of the page. We can add titles and images. Those pages are not usable and don't need any lines of code but can be tested by the user. In can be created in Adobe XD for example.

### 3. Design

The final step is when you have to add all the animations, colors, and transitions.
