# Dark VS light theme

Those modes are very different so I propose to you to enable both of them on your website. You can do it by adding a switch button on the top of your website in the menu. You can add as well that from an accurate hour, will be by default the dark or light theme. For example, the light theme can be from *8 am* until *8 pm* and the other hour the default theme can be the dark theme, I think it's the best solution because how annoying are the websites with the light theme at 1 am during a night session. Just below I made a comparison of those themes.

| Dark theme | Light theme |
| - | - |
| ✨ Use fewer resources | 😅 Use more resources |
| 👍 Less blue light | 🔵 More blue light |
| 🤓 Annoying color contrast for reading for eyes | 😎 Better contrast for reading | 

Be careful about the color contrast, more better your text-background color contrast, the more time the user will spend on your web page. Here you have a [color contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5).
