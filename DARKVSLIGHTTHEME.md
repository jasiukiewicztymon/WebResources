# Dark VS light theme

Those modes are very different so I propose to you to enable both of them on your website. You can do it by adding a switch button on the top of your website in the menu. You can add as well that from an accurate hour, will be by default the dark or light theme. For example the light theme can be from *8am* to *8pm* and the other hour the default theme can be dark theme, I personally think it's the best solution becuase how annoing are the websites with the light theme at 1am during a night session. Just below I made a comparison of those themes.

| Dark theme | Light theme |
| - | - |
| ✨ Use less resources | 😅 Use more resources |
| 👍 Less blue light | 🔵 More blue light |
| 🤓 Annoing color contrast for reading for eyes | 😎 Better contrast for reading | 

Be careful about the color contrast, more better is your text-background color contrast, more time the user will spend on your web page. Here you have a [color contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5).
